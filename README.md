## Development Guidelines

### Guard Rails for Code Changes

When making modifications to this application, please follow these principles:

#### üéØ **Minimal Change Principle**
- **Only change the minimum amount of code necessary** to implement the requested feature or fix
- Avoid refactoring unrelated code unless explicitly requested
- Preserve existing functionality and behavior
- Maintain the single-file architecture unless there's a compelling reason to split

#### üîí **Code Stability Guidelines**
- Test changes in isolation before implementing
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing localStorage data
- Preserve the authentication system and security model
- Maintain responsive design across all screen sizes

#### üìù **Change Documentation**
- Document any breaking changes or new dependencies
- Update this README if new features affect user workflow
- Note any changes to the default URL extensions or authentication

#### üö´ **What NOT to Change**
- Core authentication mechanism (unless security improvement)
- LocalStorage data structure (maintain backward compatibility)
- Basic UI layout and responsive breakpoints
- Default URL extensions without user request
- Single-file architecture (unless specifically requested)

#### ‚úÖ **Safe Change Areas**
- Adding new features within existing sections
- Improving error messages and user feedback
- Enhancing existing functionality
- Adding new URL extensions or management features
- UI/UX improvements that don't break existing workflows

### Development Workflow
1. **Identify the minimal scope** of changes needed
2. **Test changes locally** before committing
3. **Preserve existing functionality** - don't break what works
4. **Document any new features** or significant changes
5. **Maintain single-file simplicity** unless there's a compelling reason to split
